# Introduction to Excel
Introduction

This project is part of my first week of learning data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to understand how Excel works, use simple formulas to do calculations, and organize data neatly.

What I Learned and Practiced
In this assignment, I worked on three main things:

1. Getting Familiar with Excel
I explored the Excel workspace, including the menu at the top (called the Ribbon), the box where you type formulas (Formula Bar), and the different ways you can view your sheets.

2. Using Simple Math in Excel
I practiced using some basic formulas that help with calculations, such as:

SUM: Adds numbers together (e.g., total sales or expenses).

AVERAGE: Finds the average (middle value) of a set of numbers.

COUNT: Counts how many items (numbers or words) are in a list.

3. Making Data Look Neat and Organized

I changed the way numbers, text, and colors appear in Excel to make the data easier to read.
I turned a group of data into an Excel Table, which allows easy sorting and filtering (like clicking a button to only show specific information).

What I Gained from This Exercise

This practice helped me understand how Excel works and how to organize numbers and text neatly
